<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have grown up in East Hanover, New Jersey and I have been here for my whole life. One interesting fact about me is that I was born on Leap Year, 
  which for those who do not know, is February 29th, and this date only exists once every 4 years. Examples of years that this 
  day exists is 2000, 2004, 2008, and so on. My personal passions include going to the gym, eating amazing food, and learning 
  new skills. I am currently training in Powerlifting, which is a type of strength sport based around the squat, bench, and 
  deadlift exercises. My aspiration is to be the strongest man in the 90kg (198lb) weight class. </p>

<p>I am a Configuration Coordinator at Zero In Media, located in Sparta, NJ. I work with a small team to configure projects 
  for clients such as Five Guys, Cava, Sweetgreen, and many more. I mostly work with media and audio players, building device 
  racks when necessary.</p>

<p>In 3-5 years, I hope to co-own a website-creation business with my friends where we can make awesome websites for 
  businesses, whether they be small, local, or even large-scale. My friends are they type of people who can fixate on an 
  objective and continue to diligently work towards that goal, despite obstacles and setbacks. If all goes well, I hope to move 
  somewhere quiet and peaceful (with Internet of course) and spend my days traveling the world while I am still young enough to 
  enjoy everything life has to offer.</p>
